### Short Introduction 

Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest encryption techniques, it was used by Julius Caesar to send messages to his allies. 

### How Does It Work?

By replacing letters to a certain number of position. Both you and the other party should agree on a fixed number (must be an integer) of positions to solve the message, It's much easy and fun when you already know the number of positions. 

#### @Note: 
    Upper case letters in ASCII:
    'A' = 65 to 'Z' = 90
    Lower case letters in ASCII:
    'a' = 97 to 'z' = 122

### Here's an Example of The Cipher
